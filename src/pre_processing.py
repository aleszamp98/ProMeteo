    Applies the despiking algorithm based on Vickers and Mahrt (1997) to remove spikes from a time series.

    This method identifies and replaces spikes in the input array by comparing values against a running
    mean and standard deviation computed over a moving window. Points lying beyond a threshold defined
    by `c` times the local standard deviation from the local mean are considered spikes. Spikes are 
    replaced using interpolation if their number is below `max_consecutive_spikes`.

    The threshold `c` is incrementally increased after each iteration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_to_despike : np.ndarray

        Maximum number of iterations to perform if spikes continue to be found.
    logger : Optional[logging.Logger], default=None

    Compute the wind direction based on the model of the anemometer and a custom azimuth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u : array-like
        The u-component of the wind (east-west direction).
    v : array-like
        The v-component of the wind (north-south direction).
    azimuth : float
        The azimuth rotation in degrees to adjust the wind direction (e.g., instrument mounting offset).
    model : str
        The model of the anemometer, either "RM_YOUNG_81000" or "CAMPBELL_CSAT3".
    threshold : float, optional
        Minimum horizontal wind speed modulus below which the wind direction is set to NaN. Default is 0.0.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The wind direction in degrees, with 0Â° corresponding to North, 90Â° to East, etc., or NaN if below threshold.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the shapes of u and v do not match.
    ValueError
        If an unknown model is specified.
