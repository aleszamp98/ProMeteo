    Applies the despiking algorithm based on Vickers and Mahrt (1997) to remove spikes from a time series.

    This method identifies and replaces spikes in the input array by comparing values against a running
    mean and standard deviation computed over a moving window. Points lying beyond a threshold defined
    by `c` times the local standard deviation from the local mean are considered spikes. Spikes are 
    replaced using interpolation if their number is below `max_consecutive_spikes`.

    The threshold `c` is incrementally increased after each iteration.
    The process stops when no more spikes are detected or when `max_iterations` is reached.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_to_despike : np.ndarray
        The input 1D array containing the signal to be despiked.
    c : float
        Initial threshold multiplier for the standard deviation used to detect spikes.
    window_length : int
        Length of the moving window used to compute running statistics.
    max_consecutive_spikes : int
        Maximum number of consecutive spike points allowed for interpolation.
    max_iterations : int
        Maximum number of iterations to perform if spikes continue to be found.
    logger : Optional[logging.Logger], default=None
        A logger instance following the `logging.Logger` interface. If provided, the function will use it to
        log dialogues during the despiking procedure. If set to `None`, the function will operate
        silently without producing any log output.

    This method detects spikes by comparing each value in the input array against a local running median

    inter-percentile range between the 84th and 16th percentiles within the moving window:
