    Applies the despiking algorithm based on Vickers and Mahrt (1997) to remove spikes from a time series.

    This method identifies and replaces spikes in the input array by comparing values against a running

    by `c` times the local standard deviation from the local mean are considered spikes. Spikes are 
    replaced using interpolation if their number is below `max_consecutive_spikes`.

    The threshold `c` is incrementally increased after each iteration.
    The process stops when no more spikes are detected or when `max_iterations` is reached.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_to_despike : np.ndarray
        The input 1D array containing the signal to be despiked.
    c : float

        Maximum number of iterations to perform if spikes continue to be found.
    logger : Optional[logging.Logger], default=None

        silently without producing any log output.
